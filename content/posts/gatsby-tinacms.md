It's been a while (years) since this site has been anything but a rather boring intro page with nary a lnk. Like a landscaper with a dead lawn at home, I simply haven't wanted to deal with producing this site. 

## Why?

Thanks to some neat tools like Gatsby and TinaCMS, I feel like it's an excellent place to learn and post what I learn, like so many of the articles that I've benefited from out there.

## Why Gatsby?

It integrates well with additional NodeJS+React but [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is more than this site needs; [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) are probably a more appropriate platform for the use needs of this site but I wanted to learn Gatsby, eventually with comments provided through Firebase.
